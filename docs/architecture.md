# System Architecture

## Overview
DevOps Simulator follows a microservices architecture designed for high availability and scalability. The architecture supports production, development, and experimental environments.

## Components

### 1. Application Server
- Technology: Node.js + Express
- Ports: 8080 (production), 3000 (development), 9000+ (experimental)
- Scaling: Horizontal auto-scaling (production), manual single instance (development), AI-powered predictive scaling (experimental)
- Debug: Chrome DevTools on port 9229 (development)
- Experimental Features: TensorFlow.js ML inference, event-driven AI processing (experimental)

### 2. Database Layer
- Database: PostgreSQL 14
- Configuration: Master-slave replication (production), single instance (development), multi-master cluster (experimental)
- Backup: Daily automated (production), manual (development), continuous with geo-redundancy (experimental)
- Seeding: Auto-seed test data (development)
- Experimental AI Features: Query optimization, index suggestions, auto-vacuum ML (experimental)

### 3. Monitoring System
- Production: Prometheus + Grafana, email alerts
- Development: Console logging, optional Prometheus, dashboard in development
- Experimental: Prometheus + Thanos, AI log analysis, real-time anomaly detection

### 4. Container Orchestration
- Development: Docker Compose with hot reload
- Experimental: Kubernetes with custom CRDs, multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean), global load balancing

### 5. Authentication & Security
- Production: OAuth2 + JWT, SSL/TLS, DB encryption, regular audits
- Development: OAuth2 + JWT, debug endpoints exposed, CORS enabled
- Experimental: AI-assisted security monitoring, zero-trust policies

---

## Deployment Strategy
- Production: Rolling updates, zero-downtime, automated rollback
- Development: Docker Compose, hot reload, rollback via Git checkout
- Experimental: Continuous deployment with AI-assisted scaling, cross-cloud failover

---

## Development Workflow
1. Make code changes
2. Auto-reload triggers rebuild (development)
3. Run unit tests
4. Check console logs
5. Commit when ready

## Experimental Features âš 
The following features are experimental and not production-ready:
- Multi-cloud deployment
- AI-powered log analysis and predictive scaling
- Automatic rollback on anomaly detection
- Event-driven microservices with Kafka
- Real-time ML inference for monitoring and optimization
